VioletIBs
=========

Code for Both Interface Boards {CDH, Radio}. All development will take place from here.

Radio IB
========

Radio IB code will live in the radioIB folder.


CDH IB
======

CDH IB code will live in the cdhIB folder.

Rules
=====

- Always include a commit message. No commit message, Akshay rolls back
- Keep commit messages brief. If you need more details, keep it in the extended commit message
- Master ALWAYS has working code. That means, when you git checkout master and run build, everything compiles
- Use branches.
