Rules
=====

- Always include a commit message. No commit message, Akshay rolls back
- Keep commit messages brief. If you need more details, keep it in the extended commit message
- Master ALWAYS has working code. That means, when you git checkout master and run build, everything compiles
- Use branches.
- Files should have NO UPPER CASE characters.
- Variable names are word1_word2. Get that camel case out of here.
- Use tabs for indent, space to align.
