Serial Reader for Violet for use during Simulated Communications

This module is aimed primarily for use as a debugging tool during Violet's
Simulated Communications Pre-integration Review (PIR) test. 

Usage:
	There are three links that we would like to read serial data from:
	RADIO <--> RADIOIB <--> CDHIB <--> FC

	We will use 3 instances of this program with some hardware to read data at each
	stage of the test. I imagine we will see all packets going either way in all 
	links, but I am not sure. 

	RADIO <--> RADIOIB:
	For the Radio to the Radio IB link, we will use a female-female socket stripped
	at one end, the STK600, and as RS-232 to USB cable to to read packets.
	The stripped end of the socket will connect to the RX coming out of the 
	Radio breakout board. The socket end will connect to the TX pin of the STK600.
	The STK600 will then be powered on and connected to the computer running this
	code. 

	Look at the device manager to see which port corresponds to the connected
	cable. On Unix-like systems, this can be achieved by running::
		$ dmesg | grep tty 
	in the terminal. This will be the port argument to the python
	program. 

	To then read from this link, simply run::

		$ cd /dir/to/serial_reader
		$ python serial_reader.py port=port_arg chunk_size=?? message=RADIO\ TO\ RADIOIB

	The chunk size will be determined based on the packet the GS sends to the Radio.
	Calculate accordingly for each link. Additional arguments such as baudrate, parity,
	and bytesize may also be provided to override default behavior.

	RADIOIB <--> CDHIB:
	For the Radio IB to the CDHIB link, we will need the Y-splitter that lies on a
	breadboard and a RS-422 to USB converter. Again, once plugged in, make sure
	you use a device manager to determine on which port the converter resides.
	This will be the port argument to the program that reads this link. Run the
	program as described above, simply changing the port_arg and chunk_size and
	updating the message to be message=RADIOIB\ TO\ CDHIB

	CDHIB <--> FC:
	For the CDHIB to FC link, connect a DB9 cable to another RS-422 to USB 
	converter. Connect the other end of the DB9 cable to the CDH2 to FC connection
	on the EGSE. Locate the port that maintains that connection. This will be the
	port argument to the program that reads this link. Run the program as 
	described above, simply changing the port_arg and chunk_size and
	updating the message to be message=CDHIB\ TO\ FC.

	This setup allows reading all packets as they route through the Violet Power's
	hardware. However, to test this code, another setup is required.

Testing:
	Testing on a Unix-like computer requires certain tools.
	setuptools	- on linux systems, install setuptools by running in a terminal:
		wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O | sudo python
				- on Mac systems, install setuptools by running in a terminal:
		curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -o - | sudo python

		This is only required once. Once you have it installed, you should be able
		to run easy_install in your terminal. You might need sudo if you actually
		want to be able to install packages.

	termcolor	- with setuptools, run: easy_install termcolor. You might need to 
		run it as superuser, so if that doesn't work, 
		run: sudo easy_install termcolor.
		Once that's done, open up a python interpreter and make sure termcolor is
		installed by making sure 'import termcolor' throws no errors once evaluated
		in the interpreter. If there are any other modules missing, install them in
		a similar manner.

		This is only required once. If you have already installed termcolor, 
		just skip to running socat in its own terminal window.

	socat		- On *buntu computers run sudo apt-get install socat.
				- On Macs, follow the instructions on this website:
		http://www.xappsoftware.com/wordpress/2013/10/10/how-to-run-socat-on-mac-os-x/

		Once installed, run <socat -d -d pty,raw,echo=0 pty,raw,echo=0> in a terminal
		This creates a virtual serial port pair that we can test.
		socat will tell you the locations of both ports in a message 
		like <date> <time> socat[#####] N PTY is /dev/pts/xx. The /dev/pts/xx, where 
		the xx's are two numbers, is the port identifier, whichc we will call port_id.

		There will be two such messages, one for each end of the virtual
		serial port. You can then initialize the Serial Reader on one end
		of the virtual serial port. Pick the first serial port just to be consistent
		whenever you test.

		To initialize the serial reader, open a *new* terminal, <cd> to the directory
		which contains the python code, and run:
		python serial_reader.py port=port_id message=TESTING\ VIRTUAL\ PORTS
		where port_id is the first port identifier given by socat. 

		Then, open another terminal and run:
		python test_serial_reader port=port_id2
		where port_id2 is the second identifier given by socat
		Every time you want to send a packet, press enter at the prompt and a
		packet should appear in the serial_reader terminal. If not, debug baby.

		To experiment further, try changing the chunk_size for the readers and 
		testers to see which packets come in and out.
